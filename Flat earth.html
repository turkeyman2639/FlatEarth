<h1>The Earth Is Flat</h1>
<p>Everyone thinks the Earth is round, but I'm am here to tell you that the Earth is flat. 
I have done scientific research and proven the Earth is infact flat.</p>

<H2>What some people think</h2>
<p>Some people think that the Earth is Round. 
Thats just dumb it's definetly not round because if it was round then we'd be toppling over because of the slanted part of Earth.<p>
<p> Some people also think the Earth is some weird 3D shape like a cube. First off what is a cube in my opinion a cube is just something
people use to hide the fact that they are dumb and don't know what a square is. Second off if it was a cube when the Earth would spin we would all fall off. 
That's why any 3D shape doesn't work.</p>
