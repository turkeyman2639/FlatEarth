<h1>The Earth Is Flat</h1>
<p>Everyone thinks the Earth is round, but I'm am here to tell you that the Earth is flat. 
I have done scientific research and proven the Earth is infact flat.</p>

<H2>What some people think</h2>
<p>Some people think that the Earth is Round. 
Thats just dumb it's definetly not round because if it was round then we'd be toppling over because of the slanted part of Earth.<p>
<p> Some people also think the Earth is some weird 3D shape like a cube. First off what is a cube in my opinion a cube is just something
people use to hide the fact that they are dumb and don't know what a square is. Second off if it was a cube when the Earth would spin we would all fall off. 
That's why any 3D shape doesn't work.</p>

<h3>The science behind the Flat Earth</h3>
<h4>The Earth is spinning</h4>
<p>My first reason is the Earth is flat is that the Earth is spinnning. The Earth is spinning so it will become a flat circle.
 I know this because if you spin something like clay around mutiple times then in will turn into a circle. Think about it like this if someone is spinning something it will 
 turn into a flat object and that's what happend to the Earth.</p>
 <H5>Fortnite</h5>
 <p>My second and more convincing reason is Fornite. Now ypu may be asking what do Fortnite have to do with any of this?
 Well in Fortnite if you fall off the map you die. Fortnite is clearly reality and so if you fall off the edge on the Earth you will die.
 Another way to prove that the Earth is flat using Fortnite is that if you go really high up in the air 
 you see that the world in Fortnite never curves down which means it's not round.</p>

 <h6>idots may say</h6>
<p>idots are saying the Earth is round because the have picture of the Earth.
I can't belive people acually fall for that type of stuff, it's obviously made up by the government.
 The government brain washes us using chemtrails. You see chemtrails have lots of chemicals in them and those chemicals come down on us
 and make us think that the government is good and all that. Luckly  have no been brain washed and I'm here to tell you that the Earth is indeed flat.
 Now you may be asking "where did the government get the pictures from" well Nasa has been sending them.
 Nasa has been sending satellites into space to take pictures of the Earth, the people of Nasa are taking picures of Earth and doing photoshop to make it look round.
 Nasa is working with the government to make us belive the Earth is round.</p>
