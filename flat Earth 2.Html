<title>The science behind the Flat Earth</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Earth is spinning</h1>
<p>My first reason is the Earth is flat is that the Earth is spinnning. The Earth is spinning so it will become a flat circle.
 I know this because if you spin something like clay around mutiple times then in will turn into a circle. Think about it like this if someone is spinning something it will 
 turn into a flat object and that's what happend to the Earth.</p>
 <H2>Fortnite</h2>
 <p>My second and more convincing reason is Fornite. Now ypu may be asking what do Fortnite have to do with any of this?
 Well in Fortnite if you fall off the map you die. Fortnite is clearly reality and so if you fall off the edge on the Earth you will die.
 Another way to prove that the Earth is flat using Fortnite is that if you go really high up in the air 
 you see that the world in Fortnite never curves down which means it's not round.</p>
