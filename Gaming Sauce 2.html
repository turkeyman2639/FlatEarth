<h1>How does it work<h1>
<p>You may be asking "How does this sauce work?" Well, the way it works is that when you take a bath all the nutritious values from the sauce go into your blood stream.<p>
</div>
<DIv class = E>
<H2>Why are others good at the game when they haven't used the Sauce?</h2>
<p> To answer that question the reason all the gamers like Ninja or Tfue are good is that they were born with the nutritious value from Gamer Sauce. We extracted the nutrition 
from them to see what was inside to replacate it. </p>
